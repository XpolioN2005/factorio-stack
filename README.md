# Factory Stack – Prototype

## Overview

**Factory Stack** is a vertical tower-building prototype. Stack modular units to generate and move resources upward. Optimize placement to increase output, then reset the tower for permanent progression bonuses. Everything is flexible at this stage—units, resources, and mechanics are placeholders for testing core systems.

## Core Concepts

- Build a vertical tower with modular units.
- Resources flow upward and are transformed along the way.
- Optimize unit placement to maximize output.
- Reset/progress system grants permanent bonuses.
- Focus is on mechanics, not theme or visuals.

## Core Systems (Flexible)

- **Tower Units:** Different types with specific functions (TBD).
- **Resources:** Flow upward through the tower (TBD).
- **Tower Grid:** Vertical stacking system with snap-to-grid.
- **Flow System:** Units require proper input connections.
- **Persistence:** Save/load tower state.

## Prototype Focus

- Mechanics first: stacking, resource flow, connections.
- Early test of optimization and reset/progression loop.
- Keep design flexible—nothing is final.

## Project Management

- **Kanban Board:** `.vscode/kanban.js`
- Uses [Kanban Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lbauskar.kanban)

## How to Use

1. Clone repository.
2. Open project in your engine/IDE of choice.
3. Focus on implementing and testing core mechanics.
4. Use Kanban board to track tasks and iterations.
