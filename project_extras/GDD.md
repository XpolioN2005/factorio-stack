# Factory Stack – GDD Core (Flexible Draft)

**Concept:**
Build a vertical tower by stacking modular units. Resources move upward through the tower. Optimize placement to increase output. Reset the tower to gain permanent progression bonuses.

**Core Loop (Placeholder):**

1. Place units to produce resources.
2. Move resources through the tower.
3. Convert resources into higher-tier resources or currency.
4. Use currency to expand the tower.
5. Reset for permanent bonuses.

**Core Systems (Flexible):**

- **Tower Units:** Different types with specific functions (TBD).
- **Resources:** Flow upward through the tower (TBD).
- **Tower Grid:** Vertical stacking system with snap-to-grid.
- **Flow/Connection System:** Units require proper input connections to function.
- **Persistence:** Save/load tower state.

**Prototype Focus:**

- Mechanics first: stacking, resource flow, connections.
- Test basic optimization and reset/progression loop early.
